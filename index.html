              After completing high school, Musk moved to Canada to attend
              Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. He initially pursued a
              Bachelor of Arts program but later transferred to the University
              of Pennsylvania in the United States to broaden his educational
              horizons.

            <p>
              At the University of Pennsylvania, Musk pursued a dual bachelor's
              degree in Physics and Economics. He delved into the intricacies of
              physics, studying concepts such as classical mechanics,
              electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics. Simultaneously, he
              explored the economic principles that would later help him
              understand the business side of his ventures.

              He began graduate school in physics at Stanford University. While
              Musk briefly attended Stanford University, he left after only two
              days to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions. Recognizing the
              immense potential of the internet, he saw an opportunity to make a
              significant impact by starting his own companies rather than
              continuing formal education.
